                <p class="container-fluid">As a result of Covid, hotels have been hurt as well. According to the American Hotel and Lodging organization, the total amount of people working directly for hotels was  2,286,261. By September 2020 over 871,065 of those people have lost their jobs. 57,180 hotels across the nation have had to close their doors. The job loss has been driven by a lack of revenue. 

                    Restrictions by the state have had a major impact on the hotel industry. Jeff Brainard, the VP of sales and marketing at Southern Management Companies, spoke on how the limits placed by the state have hurt the hospitality industry. 

“ The stay at home order and the lack of travel has been the biggest pain to the hospitality industry and then the limit on the size of gatherings that any property can hold,” said Brainard.
