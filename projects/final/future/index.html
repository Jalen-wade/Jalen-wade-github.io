                <p>To survive, Hotels have been reaching out to congress to provide them assistance, Recovery is expected to extend into 2023 and without aid from Congress, as many as 50 percent of all travel-supported jobs could be lost by the end of December. According to the AHLA, they are estimating their to be 28,018 hotel foreclosures without congressional help along with 38,311 closures. 

“We are absolutely putting out requests to congress, to individual congressmen for aid, 6 out of 10 hospitality team members are out of work,” said Brainard.

The state of the travel industry will remain in a state of flux even in the best cases of recovery. 


Airlines have been attempting to make various precautions and changes to bring people back into terminals.  They have begun a plan to implement regulations in airports with multiple levels of  protection against the virus.  This includes constantly wearing face coverings, offering touchless check-ins,  utilizing Herpa filtration systems and partnering with medical institutions.  Airlines for America states that the aviation industry is in the “early innings of a multiyear, multistage recovery”.  Stage one will focus upon the goal of containing the virus to increase efficiency, stage two will be about making financial recovery and the third stage will be about repairing balance sheets.



“It will remain in a negative state for four to five years even if we get a vaccine, we are in for a very slow recovery. Finances will have the chance to drive costs up for airlines which will make things like higher fares appear,” said Potter.
